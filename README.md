# BDD Demo
This repo is meant to demonstrate the value of behavior-driven development. Here, I've used [Behave](https://behave.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## Prerequisites
You must have Docker installed on your local machine.

## Local setup
Clone this repo:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:christherama/behave_poc.git
```

Start Docker container:
```bash
make start
```

Run Behave tests
```bash
make test
```
